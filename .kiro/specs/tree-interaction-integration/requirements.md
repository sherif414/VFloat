# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to improve the integration between interaction composables (`useClick`, `useHover`, `useFocus`, `useDismiss`) and `useFloatingTree` to provide a more cohesive and intelligent tree-aware floating element system. Currently, the tree-aware functionality exists in separate composables (`useTreeAwareInteractions`, `useTreeInteractions`) that have some issues and don't provide seamless integration with the core interaction composables.

The goal is to create a unified system where interaction composables can automatically coordinate with floating trees when present, while maintaining backward compatibility for standalone usage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using floating elements in a tree structure, I want interaction composables to automatically coordinate with the tree when available, so that I don't need to manually manage tree-aware behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a floating context is part of a tree THEN interaction composables SHALL automatically detect and integrate with the tree
2. WHEN using interaction composables without a tree THEN they SHALL function exactly as they do currently
3. WHEN multiple interaction composables are used together on a tree node THEN they SHALL coordinate their tree-aware behaviors seamlessly
4. WHEN a tree context is provided THEN interaction composables SHALL respect tree hierarchy rules automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple and consistent API for enabling tree-aware interactions, so that I can easily configure complex floating element hierarchies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring tree-aware interactions THEN the API SHALL be consistent across all interaction types
2. WHEN enabling tree integration THEN it SHALL require minimal configuration changes from existing code
3. WHEN tree options are provided THEN they SHALL override default tree behaviors appropriately
4. WHEN tree integration is disabled THEN composables SHALL fall back to their original behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent sibling management in floating trees, so that only relevant floating elements are open at any given time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening a floating element THEN its siblings SHALL be closed automatically by default
2. WHEN a floating element closes THEN its descendants SHALL be closed automatically by default
3. WHEN an ancestor closes THEN its descendants SHALL be closed automatically by default
4. WHEN sibling closure is disabled THEN multiple siblings SHALL be allowed to remain open simultaneously

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced dismiss behavior for tree structures, so that clicking outside properly handles complex nested floating elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking outside a floating tree branch THEN only the appropriate nodes SHALL be dismissed
2. WHEN clicking within a tree branch THEN no nodes in that branch SHALL be dismissed
3. WHEN using escape key in a tree THEN only the topmost open node SHALL be dismissed
4. WHEN ancestor scroll occurs THEN appropriate descendant nodes SHALL be dismissed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want hover interactions to work intelligently with tree structures, so that hover states are maintained appropriately across tree branches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering between related tree nodes THEN the hover state SHALL be maintained appropriately
2. WHEN using safe polygon with trees THEN the polygon SHALL account for tree relationships
3. WHEN hover delays are configured THEN they SHALL coordinate with tree state changes
4. WHEN moving between tree levels THEN hover transitions SHALL be smooth and predictable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want focus management to work seamlessly with floating trees, so that keyboard navigation follows tree hierarchy naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN focus SHALL move logically through tree structure
2. WHEN a tree node gains focus THEN appropriate ancestors SHALL remain open
3. WHEN focus leaves a tree branch THEN appropriate nodes SHALL close based on configuration
4. WHEN using focus-visible THEN it SHALL work correctly within tree contexts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want click interactions to coordinate with tree state, so that clicking behaviors are consistent with tree hierarchy rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking to open a node THEN sibling nodes SHALL be managed according to tree configuration
2. WHEN clicking to close a node THEN descendant nodes SHALL be managed appropriately
3. WHEN toggle behavior is enabled THEN it SHALL work correctly within tree contexts
4. WHEN click events bubble THEN they SHALL not interfere with tree coordination

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to configure tree-aware behavior per interaction type, so that I have fine-grained control over how different interactions coordinate with the tree.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring tree options THEN each interaction type SHALL accept tree-specific configuration
2. WHEN tree options conflict THEN there SHALL be a clear resolution strategy
3. WHEN tree configuration is invalid THEN appropriate warnings SHALL be provided
4. WHEN tree options are updated reactively THEN the behavior SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript support for tree-aware interactions, so that I get proper type checking and IntelliSense.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using tree-aware interactions THEN all options SHALL be properly typed
2. WHEN tree context is missing THEN TypeScript SHALL provide appropriate warnings
3. WHEN tree options are invalid THEN TypeScript SHALL catch type errors
4. WHEN using the API THEN IntelliSense SHALL provide helpful documentation

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tree integration to be performant, so that complex floating element hierarchies don't impact application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tree coordination occurs THEN it SHALL not cause unnecessary re-renders
2. WHEN tree state changes THEN only affected nodes SHALL be updated
3. WHEN disposing tree nodes THEN all event listeners SHALL be properly cleaned up
4. WHEN tree operations execute THEN they SHALL be optimized for common use cases
